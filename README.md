<h3>Synopsis</h3>

This project involves the development of a mobile application to support the client’s security incident response process. The app we develop would help our client’s customers to recover more quickly from a security threat by allowing them to view and update a collaborative checklist, accessible to anyone relevant from their organization. Most importantly, it will have logging features that will allow the user to document their actions taken to resolve the issue. It would include a list of action items to test and update the system after recovery. Not only will this application help with incident response, but it will list steps to set up preventative measures in order to avoid the situation from occurring again. It will also make exporting easy if there is a need to share with third parties.

<3>Testing</h3>

Prerequisites: 
Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) from the official Node.js website ([https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/ "https://nodejs.org/")). 

Ensure that Git is installed on your machine. You can download it from the official Git website ([https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads "https://git-scm.com/downloads")). 

Clone the Repository: Open a terminal or command prompt. 
Navigate to the desired directory where you want to clone the repository. 
Execute the following command to clone the repository: 
```
git clone https://github.com/onlydevs-csus/cybercheck.git 
```

Change your working directory to the cloned repository's root folder. 
Execute the following command to install the required dependencies: 
```
npm install 
```

Setup: 
Open GitBash Terminal in VSCode.
Navigate to server folder. 
Execute the following command to the server:
```
npm install 
```
```
npm run build
```
```
npm run dev 
```
Open second GitBash Terminal in VSCode and navigate to cyber-check folder. 
Execute the following command to the server: 

<h3>Developer Instructions</h3>

Ensure Node.js is installed and the repo is cloned. To run the application, navigate to the front-end's root directory (cybercheck/cyber-check) and run the following commands in the terminal:

```

npm i

```

followed by

  

```

npm start

```

Once the command has finished executing, you can open your smartphone and install the Expo Go mobile application that was listed in the tools section in Configuring Development Environment. Ensure you are on the same network as the computer running the application in the terminal. If you are using an Android device, you can open the Expo Go application and scan the QR code in the terminal. If you are using an iOS device, you can open the camera app to scan the QR code in the terminal. This will connect to the local environment and open the app on your mobile device. You should be greeted with the application once the bundling is completed.

 Now open a second terminal and navigate to the server directory (cybercheck/server) and run the following commands in the terminal:

```

npm i

```

followed by

  

```

npm run build

```
and
```

npm run dev

```

This will start up the local dev environment for the backend server which will connect to the database.

Now navigate to the prompt-manager (cybercheck/prompt-manager) and run the following commands:

```

npm i

```

followed by

  

```

npm run dev

```
